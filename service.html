                                    cambopedia articles are very easy to edit. Anyone can click the "edit" link and edit an article. Obtaining formal peer review for edits is not necessary since the review is a communal function here and everyone who reads an article and corrects it is a reviewer. Essentially, cambopedia is self-correcting â€“ over time, articles improve from a multitude of contributions. There is an entire infrastructure for people seeking comments, or other opinions on editorial matters, and as a result, cambopedia has got "consensus-seeking" down to a fine art. We prefer (in most cases) that people just go in and make changes they deem necessary; the community is by and large quick to respond to dubious edits (if any) and either revert or question them. This is very efficient; our efforts seem more constructive than those on similar projects (not to mention any names).

                                    Links are created using a specific syntax, the so-called "link pattern". Originally, most cambos[citation needed] used CamelCase to name pages and create links. These are produced by capitalizing words in a phrase and removing the spaces between them (the word "CamelCase" is itself an example). While CamelCase makes linking easy, it also leads to links in a form that deviates from the standard spelling. To link to a page with a single-word title, one must abnormally capitalize one of the letters in the word (e.g. "cambo" instead of "cambo"). CamelCase-based cambos are instantly recognizable because they have many links with names such as "TableOfContents" and "BeginnerQuestions." a cambo can render the visible anchor of such links "pretty" by reinserting spaces, and possibly also reverting to lower case. This reprocessing of the link to improve the readability of the anchor is, however, limited by the loss of capitalization information caused by CamelCase reversal. For example, "RichardWagner" should be rendered as "Richard Wagner", whereas "PopularMusic" should be rendered as "popular music". There is no easy way to determine which capital letters should remain capitalized. As a result, many cambos now have "free linking" using brackets, and some disable CamelCase by default.

                                    Within the text of most pages, there are usually many hypertext links to other pages within the cambos. This form of non-linear navigation is more "native" to a wiki than structured/formalized navigation schemes. Users can also create any number of index or table-of-contents pages, with hierarchical categorization or whatever form of organization they like. These may be challenging to maintain "by hand", as multiple authors and users may create and delete pages in an ad hoc, unorganized manner. cambos can provide one or more ways to categorize or tag pages to support the maintenance of such index pages. Some cambos, including the original, have a backlink feature, which displays all pages that link to a given page. It is also typically possible in a cambo to create links to pages that do not yet exist, as a way to invite others to share what they know about a subject new to the cambo. cambo users can typically "tag" pages with categories or keywords, to make it easier for other users to find the article. For example, a user creating a new article on cold-weather biking might "tag" this page under the categories of commuting, winter sports and bicycling. This would make it easier for other users to find the article.
