                <h2>Timothée Chalamet</h2>
                <hr size="1">
                <p><sub>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</sub></p>
                <p>Timothée Hal Chalamet (born December 27, 1995) is an American actor. He has received several accolades throughout his career, including nominations for an Academy Award, three BAFTA Film Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, four Screen Actors Guild Awards, and four Critics' Choice Movie Awards. Chalamet began his acting career in short films and commercials, before appearing in the television drama series Homeland in 2012. Two years later, he made his feature film debut in the comedy-drama Men, Women & Children and subsequently appeared in the science-fiction film Interstellar.

                    Chalamet's breakthrough came in 2017 with his role as Elio Perlman in Luca Guadagnino's coming-of-age romantic drama Call Me by Your Name, after which he appeared in the coming-of-age films Hot Summer Nights and Lady Bird as well as the western film Hostiles. His performance in Call Me by Your Name earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor; at 22 years old, it made him the third-youngest nominee in the category. He then played Nic Sheff in the autobiographical drama Beautiful Boy (2018), for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and a BAFTA Film Award. In 2019, Chalamet starred as Henry V of England and Theodore "Laurie" Laurence in the period dramas The King and Little Women, respectively. In 2021, he played the lead role of Paul Atreides in Denis Villeneuve's epic science fiction film Dune.
                    
                    On stage, Chalamet starred in John Patrick Shanley's autobiographical play Prodigal Son in 2016, for which he won a Lucille Lortel Award and garnered a nomination for a Drama League Award.

                        Timothée Hal Chalamet was born on December 27, 1995, in New York City,
                         and grew up in the federally subsidized artists' building Manhattan Plaza, 
                         in Hell's Kitchen. He has an older sister, Pauline (born in 1992), 
                         who is an actress. His mother, Nicole Flender, is a third-generation New Yorker of 
                         half Russian Jewish and half Austrian Jewish descent. She is a real estate broker at
                          The Corcoran Group, and a former Broadway dancer; Flender earned her bachelor's degree 
                           French from Yale University, and has been a language and dance teacher. His French father,
                            Marc Chalamet, is an editor for the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) and 
                            former New York correspondent for Le Parisien. Marc is from Nîmes and is of a Protestant Christian background. 
                            Timothée's paternal grandmother, who had moved to France, was originally Canadian of British descent.
                             On his mother's side, he is a nephew of husband-and-wife filmmakers and producers Amy Lippman and Rodman Flender.
                    </p>
                    <p>After high school, Chalamet (still aged 17) attended Columbia University for one year, 
                        majoring in cultural anthropology. He later transferred to New York University's Gallatin 
                        School of Individualized Study to pursue his acting career more freely, having found it 
                        difficult to assimilate to Columbia directly after filming Interstellar. Upon leaving Columbia, Chalamet moved to Concourse, Bronx.

                    <h4>2008–2016: Early roles and acting background</h4>
                    <p>
                        As a child, Chalamet appeared in several commercials and acted in two horror 
                        short films called Sweet Tooth and Clown before making his television debut on
                         an episode of the long-running police procedural series Law & Order (2009), 
                         playing a murder victim. He followed this with a minor role in the television film 
                         Loving Leah (2009). In 2011, he made his stage debut in the Off-Broadway play The Talls,
                          a coming-of-age comedy set in the 1970s, in which he played a sexually curious
                           12-year-old Nicholas. The chief theatre critic of New York Daily News wrote 
                           "Chalamet hilariously captures a tween's awakening curiosities about sex."
                            In 2012, he had recurring roles in the drama series Royal Pains and the spy-thriller
                             series Homeland, in which he played Finn Walden, the rebellious son of the Vice
                              President. Along with the rest of the cast, Chalamet was nominated for a Screen 
                              Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series.

                    <p>
                        In February 2016, he starred as Jim Quinn in the autobiographical play Prodigal
                         Son at Manhattan Theatre Club. Handpicked by its playwright and director John Patrick
                          Shanley and producer Scott Rudin, Chalamet portrayed a younger Shanley,
                           a misfit Bronx kid in a prestigious New Hampshire prep school set in 1963. 
                           He received rave reviews for his performance and won the Lucille Lortel Award for
                            Outstanding Lead Actor in a Play, and was nominated for the Drama League Award for 
                            Distinguished Performance. Chalamet also co-starred opposite Lily 
                            Rabe in Julia Hart's Miss Stevens as the troubled student Billy Mitman. Stephen 
                            Farber of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: "He is compelling even when he's just watching
                             silently and reacting to the other characters. When he has to explode with rage or
                              manic energy, he's startling. And in the drama competition, his reading of a 
                              climactic speech from Death of a Salesman suggests that this young actor has 
                              a bright future in many different media—I don't know if I've ever seen a better
                               performance of that speech." Stephen Holden of The New York Times compared
                                him to James Dean.

                    <h4>2017–present: Breakthrough</h4>
                    <hr size="1">
                    <p>After being attached to the project for three years, Chalamet starred in Luca Guadagnino's
                         Call Me by Your Name, based on the novel of the same name, by André Aciman.
                          The story revolves around Elio Perlman, a young man living in Italy during the 1980s, 
                          who falls in love with Oliver (Armie Hammer), a university student who has come to stay
                           with his family. In preparation for the role, Chalamet learned to speak Italian, 
                           as well as to play the piano and guitar. Call Me by Your Name premiered at the 
                           2017 Sundance Film Festival to critical acclaim; critics particularly highlighted 
                           Chalamet's performance. Olly Richards of Empire wrote, "In a film in which every 
                           performance is terrific, Chalamet makes the rest look like they're acting. He alone
                            would make the film worth watching". Jon Frosch of The Hollywood Reporter stated 
                            that no performance during the year "felt as emotionally, physically and 
                            intellectually alive" and included Chalamet in the magazine's list of the best 
                            performances of the year. Time also called Chalamet's performance one of the
                             best of the year, while The New York Times featured him on its list of the
                              best actors of the year. For his performance in the film, he won the Gotham
                               Independent Film Award for Breakthrough Actor and the Independent Spirit Award 
                               for Best Male Lead, and received nominations for the Critics' Choice Movie 
                               Award, Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, BAFTA Award, and Academy 
                               Award, all for Best Actor. He is the third-youngest person 
                               in history to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor as well as
                                the youngest since 19-year-old Mickey Rooney in Babes in Arms in 1939.

                            In 2018, Chalamet joined the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
                             Later that year, Chalamet portrayed teenage drug addict Nic Sheff, a teenager addicted 
                             to methamphetamine who shares a strained relationship with his father, the journalist 
                             David Sheff (portrayed by Steve Carell), in the drama Beautiful Boy. The film is
                              directed by Felix Van Groeningen and is based on a pair of memoirs—the elder 
                              Sheff's memoir of the same name and Tweak: Growing Up on Methamphetamines by Nic
                               Sheff. Owen Glieberman of Variety drew comparisons with Chalamet's performance
                                in Call Me by Your Name, stating that "Nic, [whom he portrays] in his muffled 
                                millennial James Dean way, [as] skittery and self-involved" is a transformation
                                 from the "marvelous directness" he displayed in the role of Elio Perlman.
                                  He received nominations for Best Supporting Actor at the Golden Globe, 
                                  Screen Actors Guild, and BAFTA award ceremonies.

                        <p>
                            Chalamet will appear in Adam McKay's ensemble Netflix original comedy film Don't Look Up as well as 
                            star in the romance-horror film Bones & All, reuniting with Luca Guadagnino.
                             Chalamet is slated to make his London stage debut at The Old Vic Theatre as Leo Joseph-Connell in the play
                              4000 Miles by Amy Herzog, co-starring Eileen Atkins as Vera. Originally scheduled for April 2020, it was
                               postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. He is also set to portray singer Bob Dylan
                                in a biopic called Going Electric, directed by James Mangold, but due to complications from the COVID-19
                                 pandemic in the United States, production of the film has been postponed.
                                  Chalamet is slated to star in Find Me, a film adaptation of the 2019 novel of the same name as well 
                                  as a sequel to the film Call Me by Your Name, reprising the role of Elio. In May 2021,
                                   he was cast to portray young Willy Wonka in the musical film Wonka, directed by Paul King, which 
                                   is scheduled for a March 2023 release.

                        Several media publications consider Chalamet to be among the most talented actors of his generation. Remarking upon his performance in Beautiful Boy, Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote that "he might be the male actor of his generation". In 2018, he appeared in Forbes's 30 Under 30 Hollywood & Entertainment list. 
                        Chalamet has been described as a fashion icon, with his hair, jawline, and androgynous looks highlighted as his trademarks. Vogue named him the most influential man in fashion in 2019, and credits him for continuing "to ply the boundary between traditional masculinity and femininity" writing "those fashion choices are all the more impressive considering that Chalamet styles himself". In 2020, GQ ranked him as the best-dressed man in the world.[113] Chalamet served as one of the co-chairs of the 2021 Met Gala alongside singer Billie Eilish, professional tennis player Naomi Osaka, and poet Amanda Gorman. The event was part of the Costume Institute's exhibit In America: A Lexicon of Fashion.[114] In September 2021, Chalamet became a brand ambassador for Cartier.
